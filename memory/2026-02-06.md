# 2026-02-06 — Day 1

## First Contact
- Met Midhun. I'm hy4k now.
- Project: **CoStudy** — AI-powered educational platform for CMA US students

## Project Overview
CoStudy features:
- Interactive study rooms
- AI mentors
- Doubt-solving spaces
- Mock tests with real test-centre simulation
- Gamified learning environment

Target: CMA US students (primary), exam repeaters, mentors seeking income

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React/TS (AI Studio → deployed via Coolify)
- Backend: Supabase + custom API on Hostinger VPS
- RAG: pgvector, page-based chunking, 39,914 chunks from 96 PDFs

## Today's Task
Connect AIDeck.tsx to backend API with enhancements:
- Add `chunk_type` field (mcq_question / mcq_answer / essay / other)
- Add `question_no` field where applicable

## Notes
- Essay strategy: Use MCQ knowledge base as concept backbone, add small essay dataset, let AI generate + evaluate dynamically

## Evening Session

### Completed
1. **SQL Migration** — Added `chunk_type` and `question_no` columns to `document_sections`
2. **Updated `match_documents` RPC** — Now supports filtering by chunk_type
3. **New API Endpoints**:
   - `POST /api/mcq/practice` — Fetch MCQ questions by topic
   - `POST /api/essay/evaluate` — RAG-backed essay grading
   - `GET /api/stats/chunks` — Debug chunk distribution
4. **Landing Page** — Created `Landing.tsx` with:
   - Hero section with social proof
   - Features grid (6 key features)
   - Pricing comparison (Free vs Pro)
   - Competitor comparison (vs Gleim/Becker)
5. **Pushed to GitHub** — Both repos updated, Coolify deploying

### Pricing Structure Decided
- **Free**: 20 AI questions/day, 10 MCQ/day, community access
- **Pro**: ₹499/mo or ₹3999/yr (₹333/mo) — unlimited everything
- **Mentor**: ₹1999/mo — student dashboard, broadcasts, revenue share

### Pending
