## 3:30 AM Session — The Core Vision

Midhun revealed the two flagship features that should anchor all marketing:

### Feature 1: The Social Wall (Academic Intelligence Hub)

**Philosophy**: Not a social feed — a high-signal knowledge exchange.

**Post Types (+ Button)**:
- Standard Question (tagged by CMA Part/Section)
- MCQ Share (formatted A/B/C/D)
- Resource Drop (summaries, cheat sheets, videos)
- Peer Audit Request (essay logic review per IMA standards)

**Visibility Logic ("Academic Radar")**:
1. Aligned Peers (Contractors) — priority
2. Expert Tier Content (Teachers, high-rep students)
3. Signal Matches (context-aware, e.g., Revision Mode → #ExamStrategy)
4. Global Pulse (trending academic debates)

**Specialized Feeds (Desks)**:
- Audit Desk — Peer essay reviews, Compliant/Non-Compliant verdicts
- Bounty Board — Gig economy for study tasks, earn Credits/Badges
- Strategic Notes — Curated high-density guides
- Expert Q&A — Verified mentors only
- Discussions — Long-form academic debates

**Mechanics**:
- Vouches (not Likes) — professional endorsements, impact Reputation Score
- Threaded Logic Tree — Audit Trail for arguments
- Summary Button — Gemini Flash generates 3 bullet points instantly

### Feature 2: CMA Alignment Network (CAN) — The Crown Jewel

**Philosophy**: High-stakes exams need professional-grade accountability. "Contractors, not Friends."

**The Protocol**:
1. **Signal Intercept** — Academic Radar scans globally, shows peers hitting 80%+ in topics you struggle with
2. **Treaty Request** — Contract Proposal with Purpose, Duration, Mission Goal (not a friend request)
3. **Synchronized Metrics** — Shared Radar (live telemetry), Streak-Lock (mutual accountability)
4. **Context-Only Messaging** — DMs anchored to Missions, no fluff

**USPs**:
- Cross-Timezone Intelligence — India sleeps, USA audits their essays, wake up to feedback (24/7 Academic Factory)
- Enforced Professionalism — Low Consistency Score = "Low-Signal" = can't align with elite peers
- Mission Control Dashboard — Combined Tactical View, side-by-side progress bars
- Micro-Consulting SOS — 15-min Rapid Response audio sessions globally

**Visual Elements**:
- Line of Unity — Glowing violet connection on Radar map
- Contract Badge — Track record of Successful Alignments
- Global Pulse Ticker — "Active Alignments: 1,420 (India ↔ USA...)"

## TODO
- [x] Update Landing.tsx to emphasize these two features prominently
- [x] Consider dedicated sections with visual mockups

## 3:44 AM — Feature 3 Revealed: Study Rooms / Cluster Hubs

- Shared Ledger — Encrypted vault for resources/audit logs
- Radio Silence Mode — Room-wide focus timer, dark theme

**Stickiness Mechanics**:

- Room vs Room Leaderboards — Mumbai vs London
- Scheduled Ops — Auto-generated rendezvous based on timezones

**Faculty Hive — Micro-Crowdfunded Mentorship**:
1. SOS Signal — Any member clicks "Enlist Specialist"
2. Marketplace Pull — See verified mentors online for Flash Sessions
3. Split-Fee Logic — ₹2500 session ÷ 5 members = ₹500 each
4. Escrow + Vouch Release — Room vouches → funds released
5. Platform Fee — CoStudy takes 10-15%

**Visual Experience**:
