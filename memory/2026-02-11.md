## Premium Landing Page Redesign (Late Night - 00:47)

Instead of vertical feature stacking, the page now tells a story:
- "Here's What Happens When You Open CoStudy..."
- Scene 01: The Alignment (matching with NYC peer)
- Scene 02: The Command Deck (peer audit interaction)
- Scene 03: The Study Rooms (synchronized focus timer)

### Visual Enhancements

- Glowing edges on hover (gradient blur effects)
- Animated icons:
  - Brain: pulse
  - Award: bounce
  - Pencil: wiggle animation
  - TrendingUp: grow animation
  - Globe: slow spin
- Scroll-triggered reveal animations via Intersection Observer

### Interactive Pricing Calculator
- Users select current spend (Gleim/Becker/Hock/Custom)
- Dynamically shows savings vs CoStudy Pro (₹3,999/year)
- Shows percentage saved and additional features

### Positioning Change
- From: EdTech/Coaching platform
- To: "Global Exam Performance Infrastructure"
- Badge: "Global Exam Performance Infrastructure"
- Urgency: "X students joined today", "May 2026 exam in 89 days"

### Premium Quotes Placed
1. Hero: "The Exam is Global. Your Preparation Should Be Too."
2. Hero sub: "You're not studying alone anymore. Somewhere, someone is solving what you're stuck on — right now."
3. Features: "Not More Studying. Smarter Passing."
4. Alignment scene: "The sun never sets on your preparation."

### Technical
- Custom `useScrollReveal` hook for Intersection Observer
